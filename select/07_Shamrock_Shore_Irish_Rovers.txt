From Derry quay we sailed away on the twenty-third of May
We were taken on board by a pleasant crew, bound for Amerikay
Fresh water then we did take on, five thousand gallons or more
In case we'd run short going to New York far away from the shamrock
Shore

Then fare thee well, sweet Liza dear and likewise unto Derry town
And twice farewell to my comrades brave that dwell on that sainted
Ground
If fame or fortune shall favour me, and I to have money in store
I'll go back and I'll wed the wee lassie I left on Paddy's green
Shamrock shore

At twelve o'clock we came in sight of famous Mullin Head
And Innistrochlin to the right stood out on the ocean's bed
A grander sight ne'er met my eyes than e'er I saw before
Than the sun going down 'twixt sea and sky far away from the shamrock
Shore

We sailed three weeks,
We were all seasick, not a man on board was free
We were all confined unto our bunks and no one to pity poor me
No father kind nor mother dear to lift up my head, which was sore
Which made me think more on the
Lassie I left on Paddy's green shamrock
Shore

We safely reached the other side after fifteen and twenty days
We were taken as passengers by a man and led round in six different
Ways
Then each of us drank a parting glass, in case we'd meet no more
And we drank a health to old Ireland and Paddy's green shamrock shore

We landed on the other side
In three and thirty days
And drinking over a parting glass
We all went our separate ways
We took each comrade by the hand
In case we might never meet more
And we drank a health
To old Ireland
And Paddy's green shamrock shore
