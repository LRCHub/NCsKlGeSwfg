In the dock a ship was anchored
On a bright St. Patrick's day
On the quay a lass was sighing
For her lover going away.

In her hand she held an emblem
And its parted leaves were three
And her parting words were "Darlin'
Look at these and think of me."

Three leaf shamrock I adore thee
Your three leaves I long to see
When there's brighter days in Ireland
I'll come home and marry thee.

Just before the ship had started
As she laid her hand on mine
Just before that we had parted
She looked with loving eyes so kind.

To my coat she pinned an emblem
And its parted leaves were three
And her parting words were "Darlin'
Look at these and think of me."

But tonight I am an exile
Far from home and far from thee
Next my heart I'll wear your token
Love no matter where I live.

And although the seas divide us
And your face I might never see
When there's brighter days in Ireland
I come home and marry thee.

Three leaf shamrock I adore thee
Your three leaves I long to see
When there's brighter days in Ireland
I'll come home and marry thee...
